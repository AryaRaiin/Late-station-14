[color=#ff0000]YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 16 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY ON LateStation SERVERS. ANY USERS SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE BANNED UNTIL THEY ARE OF AGE.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]DISCONNECTING FROM OR IGNORING/EVADING ADMIN-HELPS WILL RESULT IN AN APPEAL ONLY BAN.[/color]

This is the "short" form of the rules, which has all the information any regular player should need. You can find the "long" form of the rules with more examples & clarifications of any ambiguity on our Discord.
Should you need it. Some RP-specific documents available on the wiki such as Space Law, the Standard Operating Procedure, and the Alert Procedure will be mentioned here and are expected to be followed.

[color=#ff0000]Recent Changes[/color]
- Additional rule clarifications available on the Discord, or ping Late or Rebound for any questions.

[color=#a4885c]01.[/color] [color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins may exercise discretion with rules as they see fit. If you rule lawyer or line skirt, you will get removed.

[color=#ff0000]ZERO TOLERANCE RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]02.[/color] Absolutely no hate speech, slurs, bigotry, racism, specism (demeaning other characters in-game due to their in-game race), sexism, or anything even remotely similar. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED)

[color=#a4885c]03.[/color] Absolutely no Erotic Roleplay (ERP) or sexual content, including direct or indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED) (Leeway is given to insults, e.g., 'You are a dickhead', do not push it)

[color=#a4885c]04.[/color] Don't communicate in-game/in-character information through methods outside of the game (such as talking in Discord with other users actively playing or by talking to your sibling across the room while you are both playing). This is referred to as "Metacomming". Administrators cannot police metacommunications; we must assume it is being abused. (All involved will get PERMABANNED)

[color=#a4885c]05.[/color] Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban that is only appealable after six months and only with a voucher of good behavior from another SS13/SS14 server. Attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban. (YOU WILL GET BANNED MUCH WORSE THAN YOU ALREADY WERE)

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]06.[/color] These are English servers. Speak only English in IC and OOC.

[color=#a4885c]07.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt/crash the round/server. This includes autoclickers and scripts to automate the game or evade AFK detection. Intentionally attempting to lag/crash the server will result in an immediate appeal-only ban.

[color=#a4885c]08.[/color] Don't use multiple SS14 accounts to play (referred to as "multi-keying"). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#a4885c]09.[/color] Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with spam messages, checking for admins before stating a problem (e.g., "hello?", "any admins?"). Hostility to administrators in the relay will likely result in your removal. All admin helps are sent to the LateStation Discord relay.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 0: Don't be a dick[/color]
Practice common sense while consulting these rules. The general idea counts, not the exact wording. The rules are guidelines for the server and should be interpreted to suit the situation at hand, not manipulated to suit your needs. Attempting to Rules-Lawyer an Administrator is never a good idea, and likely to result in harsher punishment.

The Server Staff retains the right to issue Permanent Bans to players that they consider to be a consistent net negative to the community and server, without the need for any specific Rule to be broken.

The Staff Members have final say on the server. If you are banned or job banned from the server, ban appeals will be handled on the Discord.

The Adminhelp system is not to be spammed. If you do not get a response, the Administrators are either busy with other matters or not available.

When in doubt, Adminhelp any question you may have about the Server Rules.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 1: Roleplaying Standards[/color]
The following behaviors are prohibited on LateStation:

- **Metagaming** (using OOC information acquired via means unavailable to other players. Examples include, but are not limited to, third-party software or direct, physical communication). Streaming is allowed.

- Placing current round information into OOC chat (IC in OOC);

- Using LOOC to talk to others to give them current round information. This applies to Ghosts as well. If you want to provide minor instruction to a nearby player, please inform the Server Staff before doing so.

- Using multiple accounts for yourself during a round (Multikeying) is not allowed.

- When it comes to suiciding, do not suicide upon getting caught, or when converted by a conversion Antagonist.

LateStation is a medium role-playing server. You’re not expected to be 100% immersed in everything that is happening. However, we still expect players to act in character at all times, in a manner befitting Space Station 14. The game has many clashing themes and many unserious tones, but generally try to take things as seriously as you would if you were in your character’s shoes.

We do not restrict knowledge of any antagonists, but you may pick and choose what your character knows. Job knowledge is restricted within reason; for example, an engineer should not know how to make complex medicines. In an extreme crisis or to save your own life, you may stretch this information.

New Life Rule is in effect; you remember all events up until you fall unconscious unless you enter a dead state. Being defibrillated will return all your memories except for the events leading up to your death. You may remember vague descriptors of who or what killed you. Examples include: Shot, stabbed, burned. You may also describe crew member, borg, or a mob species like carp. Avoid going into specifics like species or gender of crew members though. Being cloned/borged will make your character forget everything since the shift started.

Administrators may ask you to change your behavior if it is seen by the Server Staff as damaging the IC atmosphere of the server. Examples include, but are not limited to: references to memes or real-life events, reference characters (Gregory House, Walter White), or inappropriate play on words.

Your character is an employee of Nanotrasen. Names should be context-appropriate and support appropriate role-play. Stage names have more creative freedom. This includes roles like the clown, mime, and musician.

If you think a name should be allowed that an admin thinks of otherwise, this can be sent for review. However, until the review is finalized, the decision of the admin at the time remains.

Netspeak should be avoided, unless you’re writing on a PDA or piece of paper.

[color=#a4885c]Power Gaming[/color]
Powergaming can simply be defined as putting your own mechanical advantages ahead of other people's enjoyment or the development of engaging role-playing scenarios. It should be avoided in favor of strategies that both encourage and promote the enjoyment of all parties involved. Administrators may ask you to tone down your play if it is disruptive, or a pattern of power gaming is noticed.

[color=#a4885c]Flavour Text[/color]
Your character's flavor text should only contain information that any other character couldn’t notice at a glance. The flavor text shouldn't contain any information about a feature (like personality, past, and so on) that isn't immediately apparent.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 2: SSD Players[/color]
SSD Players are players that have disconnected from the game. They can be identified by examining them, which will reveal yellow text indicating they might return.

You may not touch or interact with people under the influence of 'Sudden Sleep Disorder' except to pull them to a Cryosleeper, to provide medical care to SSD players, such as medication or surgery, or to remove them from an immediate life-threatening situation, such as a plasma fire.

Antagonists may loot non-antag SSD players, but looting the captain, who clearly crashed in a public hall, is not fun gameplay for anyone. If they are your target, feel free to do what you have to.
If the person goes SSD immediately after an arrest, you are free to continue processing and brigging them as if they were still awake.

If you believe an SSD person needs to be interacted with (such as an SSD Captain needing to have their equipment removed), ask the Administrators first.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 3: Maintaining a Respectful Environment[/color]
Under no circumstances is OOC harassment of another player allowed, regardless of who the victim is. Repeated IC harassment with little to no reason can be considered metagrudging;

Racial, Homophobic, Ethnic, Religious, etc., slurs are not allowed ICly or OOCly. Terms such as "f-slur" and "n-slur", or any variations on them are strictly prohibited. Speciesism is also prohibited.

Be respectful to everyone. Every character is played by a real human being. Frustration is natural and a part of roleplay, but actively harassing someone can leave a bad
